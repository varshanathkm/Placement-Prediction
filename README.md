# Placement-Prediction


The Placement Prediction App is built using Python, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization tools, integrating algorithms that process historical placement data to generate predictive insights.

The model enables:

* Students to assess their placement likelihood and identify areas for improvement.
* Colleges to evaluate student readiness and optimize training programs.
* Recruiters to find suitable candidates efficiently.

#some of the major technologies used

The project utilizes:

* Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
* Data Preprocessing(Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
